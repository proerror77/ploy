# Collector consolidation TODO

## Goal
Reduce duplicated market-data collection paths and converge on canonical raw tables.

## Phase 1 (start now)

- [x] Inventory current collector and persistence paths (tables + writers + overlap)
- [x] Add explicit consolidation plan
- [x] Make `orderbook-history` write canonical `clob_orderbook_snapshots` (while keeping legacy `clob_orderbook_history_ticks` for compatibility)
- [x] Add migration note for consumers currently reading `clob_orderbook_history_ticks`

## Phase 2

- [x] Convert `sync_records` from primary sink to derived layer (view/materialized view over raw tables)
- [x] Remove duplicated schema DDL from runtime/CLI paths and centralize
- [x] Deprecate legacy `ticks` pathway after read-side migration

## Phase 3

- [x] Remove or archive `backtest_collector` CSV-only flow from primary data pipeline
- [ ] Add one unified collector docs page (what to run for live vs backfill vs research)
- [ ] Add lightweight data-quality checks (freshness + dedup ratios)

## Progress notes

- 2026-03-04: Started Phase 1 implementation.
- 2026-03-04: `OrderbookHistoryCollector` now mirrors into canonical `clob_orderbook_snapshots` with dedup-by-key (`token_id`, `book_timestamp`, `hash`, `source`) checks.
- 2026-03-04: Added migration note at `tasks/collector_migration_note.md`.
- 2026-03-04: Added `platform::persistence_schema` and switched bootstrap + CLI replay backfill table ensures to shared helpers.
- 2026-03-04: `SyncCollector` now persists canonical raw tables (`binance_lob_ticks`, `clob_quote_ticks`) and creates `sync_records_derived` view; legacy `sync_records` writes are compatibility-only behind `PLOY_COLLECTOR_PERSIST_SYNC_RECORDS`.
- 2026-03-04: Legacy `services/data_collector` now defaults to canonical `clob_quote_ticks`; legacy `ticks` writes require `PLOY_LEGACY_TICKS_ENABLED=true`.
- 2026-03-04: `backtest_collector` CSV sink is now compatibility-only (`persist_csv=false` by default), so primary collector pipeline is DB-first.

# Strategy Deployment Control Plane Stabilization TODO (2026-03-05)

## Goal
Reduce strategy "listing/deployment" chaos by enforcing one control semantics across API surfaces and removing unsafe strategy fallback behavior in platform bootstrap.

## Tasks

- [x] Create implementation plan doc under `docs/plans/` for this stabilization work.
- [x] Align enable/disable governance between `/api/deployments` and `/api/strategies/control/:id`.
- [x] Ensure enabling via `/api/strategies/control/:id` enforces the same evidence gate rules as `/api/deployments`.
- [x] Remove implicit unknown-strategy -> momentum fallback in deployment matrix application.
- [x] Add/adjust tests for deployment strategy mapping and API enable gate behavior.
- [x] Reconcile direct-live gate tests with current documented behavior (blocked by default, env override explicit).
- [x] Run targeted tests and capture results.
- [x] Commit atomic changes with clear scope messages.

## Review

- [x] Verified no unrelated dirty changes were reverted.
- [x] Verified control plane behavior is consistent across endpoints.
- [x] Verified strategy mapping no longer silently routes unknown strategy keys to momentum.

# Trading Host OOM Hardening TODO (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Prevent trading host OOM/timeout caused by on-host Rust builds and missing service memory guards.

## Tasks

- [x] Verify `tango-1-1` runtime state (`rustc/cargo`, `systemd` restart/memory policy, active build processes).
- [x] Pin host default Rust commands to rustup stable (`rustc/cargo` -> latest stable).
- [x] Enforce/automate `systemd` guardrails (`Restart`, `MemoryHigh`, `MemoryMax`, `OOMPolicy`) in GitHub Actions deploy flow.
- [x] Disable legacy remote source-build deploy path by default (`scripts/aws_ec2_deploy.sh` requires explicit override).
- [x] Add trading-host deployment policy to `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

## Review

- [x] Confirmed host now reports `rustc 1.94.0` and `cargo 1.94.0`.
- [x] Confirmed `ploy-platform.service` shows `Restart=always`, `MemoryHigh=1280M`, `MemoryMax=1536M`, `OOMPolicy=kill`.
- [x] Confirmed no active `cargo`/`rustc` compile processes remain on host.

# LEG2 Hotfix Rollout And Acceptance (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Deploy the staggered-arb LEG2 partial-fill hotfix, restart the live platform, and verify online that retries only submit remaining shares while auto-claimer remains active.

## Tasks

- [x] Reproduce the LEG2 retry issue from live fills/logs and identify root cause.
- [x] Implement cumulative LEG2 fill tracking with remaining-shares resubmission.
- [x] Add targeted tests for partial-cancel and cumulative-fill closeout behavior.
- [x] Deploy the hotfix binary to the live host and restart `ploy-platform`.
- [x] Confirm post-restart strategy runtime and auto-claimer startup logs.
- [ ] Confirm a fresh post-restart `STAG-ARB` trade path no longer re-submits full LEG2 size after a partial/failed attempt.
- [x] Review BTC live activity and document why BTC did or did not trade.

## Review

- [x] Local targeted tests and `cargo check` passed before deployment.
- [x] Live host restarted onto the new binary with `--features claimer`.
- [x] Post-restart runtime confirmed active for `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`, `SOLUSDT`; auto-claimer startup confirmed in live logs.
- [x] BTC feed/runtime coverage confirmed after restart; absence of BTC trades so far is lack of qualifying fills/signals in the observed window, not missing subscription.
- [x] No post-restart `orderbook ... does not exist` execution errors were observed in the acceptance window.
- [ ] Fresh post-restart order-path acceptance still pending a real `LEG1` fill that advances into `LEG2`.

# STAG-ARB Live Quote Scoping And Forced-Close Hardening (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Stop live staggered-arb from mixing quotes across event windows, make forced-close price guards real, and ensure runtime config injection does not silently drop BTC.

## Tasks

- [x] Stop live `ploy-platform.service` on `tango-1-1` before local strategy changes.
- [x] Add targeted tests that prove live quotes must be scoped by `event_id`, not only symbol.
- [x] Add targeted tests for `force_complete_threshold` guarding forced Leg2 closes above threshold.
- [x] Change `staggered_arb_live` quote routing/storage from symbol-scoped to event-scoped.
- [x] Wire `force_complete_threshold` into live forced-close paths only.
- [x] Align backtest forced-close threshold semantics with live behavior.
- [x] Fix bootstrap staggered-arb runtime rendering so deployment-scoped `symbols` and `series_ids` override the canonical template without silently dropping BTC.
- [x] Run targeted strategy/bootstrap tests and capture results.

## Review

- [x] Confirmed `ploy-platform.service` on `tango-1-1` is stopped before implementation.
- [x] Verified live staggered-arb no longer reuses quotes across different windows for the same symbol.
- [x] Verified forced close does not buy Leg2 above configured threshold.
- [x] Verified runtime-rendered staggered-arb config injects both symbols and series IDs.

## Progress notes

- 2026-03-06: `tango-1-1` `ploy-platform.service` stopped successfully; host reported `inactive (dead)` immediately after manual stop.
- 2026-03-06: Added live regression test `test_try_entry_uses_event_scoped_quotes` and switched live PM quote storage/routing to `event_id` scope.
- 2026-03-06: Added live/backtest threshold tests so forced timeout paths are blocked when `force_complete_threshold=1.00` and combined sum exceeds $1.
- 2026-03-06: Added live event-expiry settlement path so single-leg `FINAL WINDOW HOLD` positions and threshold-blocked positions do not remain stuck open forever.
- 2026-03-06: Fixed bootstrap staggered-arb runtime rendering so managed config derives from the canonical template while overriding both deployment-scoped symbols and series IDs.
- 2026-03-06: Verified with targeted tests:
  - `cargo test test_try_entry_uses_event_scoped_quotes -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test test_force_threshold_blocks_forced_timeout_above_cap -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test test_force_complete_threshold_blocks_backtest_timeout_above_cap -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test build_split_arb_runtime_config_overrides_template_symbols_and_series_ids -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test staggered_arb_live::tests -- --nocapture`

# Managed Staggered Arb Runtime And Release Workflow Merge (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Fold the separate hotfix worktree back into this strategy branch without regressing the live quote-scoping fixes: keep share-based managed runtime generation, preserve partial-fill retry behavior, and make the Aliyun release workflow explicitly start inactive ploy services.

## Tasks

- [x] Compare the current worktree against `hotfix/leg2-reconcile-20260306` and identify overlapping files.
- [x] Keep the live `staggered_arb` partial-fill reconciliation logic while verifying it does not conflict with event-scoped quote routing.
- [x] Reconcile managed runtime generation in `bootstrap.rs` so it derives from the canonical `staggered_arb.toml` template instead of hardcoded fallback defaults.
- [x] Bring over the release workflow changes that package/install `staggered_arb.toml` and explicitly `start` or `restart` installed ploy services.
- [x] Merge both sessions' `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md` records instead of dropping one side's incident history.
- [x] Run targeted validation on merged bootstrap/workflow changes and capture the result.

## Review

- [x] Confirmed the only real semantic conflict was managed runtime generation in `bootstrap.rs`; `staggered_arb_live.rs` changes were additive.
- [x] Kept `force_complete_threshold = 1.00` in the checked-in strategy template to preserve the bad-price forced-close guard.
- [x] Preserved the hotfix-side partial-fill retry logic and exchange-order reconciliation already present in the current worktree.

## Progress notes

- 2026-03-06: Compared this worktree with `hotfix/leg2-reconcile-20260306` and found overlap in `bootstrap.rs`, `staggered_arb.toml`, `staggered_arb_live.rs`, `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/lessons.md`, plus the uncommitted `release-aliyun.yml` follow-up.
- 2026-03-06: Resolved bootstrap by keeping template-derived managed runtime rendering and deployment-scoped overrides for `symbols` and `series_ids`.
- 2026-03-06: Resolved workflow merge by keeping packaged `staggered_arb.toml`, explicit ploy unit handling, and `wait_for_unit_active` for both `start` and `restart` paths.
- 2026-03-06: Revalidated merged state with `cargo test bootstrap -- --nocapture`, `cargo test build_split_arb_runtime_config_ -- --nocapture`, `cargo test staggered_arb_live::tests -- --nocapture`, and a YAML parse check for `.github/workflows/release-aliyun.yml`.

# Managed Staggered Arb Runtime And Release Workflow Closure (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Keep managed `staggered_arb` on share-based sizing, ship the canonical strategy template in release bundles, and make the Aliyun rollout path recover installed inactive services automatically.

## Tasks

- [x] Confirm managed runtime sizing drift came from bootstrap rendering, not host config drift.
- [x] Render managed split-arb runtime from the canonical `staggered_arb.toml` template while keeping runtime symbol/series overrides.
- [x] Include `staggered_arb.toml` in the release bundle and install it on the host during rollout.
- [x] Update the release restart step so installed inactive `ploy` services are started and waited to `active`.
- [x] Extend the release restart step to include installed `ploy-deribit-*` collectors.

## Review

- [x] Managed runtime rendering now preserves `shares_per_trade = 20` and does not inject `fixed_amount_usd`.
- [x] Release workflow now deploys `staggered_arb.toml` alongside `momentum.toml`.
- [x] Release workflow restart logic now handles both `restart` and `start`, with an explicit `active` wait loop.
- [x] Release workflow now discovers and restarts installed `ploy-deribit-*` collector units on the trading host.

# Layered Live Runtime Refactor Design And Planning (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Define the target four-layer live trading architecture and write a concrete implementation plan to converge the repo onto one canonical strategy runtime.

## Tasks

- [x] Review the current architecture against the target four-layer model.
- [x] Validate target boundaries for Strategy, Capital Governance, Execution, and Control planes.

# Staggered Arb OBI Long-Gamma Capped-Loss Refactor (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Shift staggered-arb from mixed "old arb threshold + opening-window directional entry" behavior into an OBI-triggered long-gamma profile with capped-loss LEG2 stops and Greeks-aware merge acceleration.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add targeted failing tests for capped-loss stop completion above the generic force cap, Greeks-accelerated LEG2 close, and long-gamma entry band filtering.
- [ ] Add strategy config support for stop-loss-specific completion caps and long-gamma fair-value band filtering.
- [ ] Update live and backtest LEG2 logic so stop-loss uses the capped-loss threshold while profitable gamma/theta urgency behaves consistently.
- [ ] Re-run targeted staggered-arb tests and a local backtest comparison window.

## Review

- [ ] Confirm the new stop-loss path caps directional damage without reopening the old bad-price forced-close bug.
- [ ] Confirm Greeks remain a secondary state filter/exit accelerator rather than the primary entry signal.

# ETH Up/Down Missing Settlement Investigation On tango-1-1 (2026-03-07)

## Goal
Find why the ETH 5-minute Up/Down order pair appears to have been bought but is no longer visible with no obvious settlement result.

## Tasks

- [ ] Confirm live host services and identify the components responsible for order tracking and claim/settlement.
- [ ] Collect host evidence for the 2026-03-07 01:05-01:10 CST window (ETH Up/Down 2026-03-06 12:05PM-12:10PM ET).
- [ ] Determine whether the order disappeared because of fill/cancel behavior, event-expiry handling, local state loss, or unresolved claim processing.
- [ ] Summarize root cause and required fix or operational follow-up.

## Review

- [ ] Root cause is supported by host evidence, not inference alone.

---

# Staggered Arb Delayed-Entry OBI And Real-Time Partial-Fill Refactor (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Shift `staggered_arb` to the operator's intended flow: wait through the first 30 seconds, let OBI choose `LEG1` direction without a hard sum cap, then manage `LEG2` against the actually-filled size with immediate partial-fill accounting and bounded-loss closes up to a wider cap.

## Tasks

- [x] Add failing tests for delayed post-open entry (`entry_after_start_min_secs`), disabled hard `max_initial_sum` gating, and unlimited concurrency/event-count settings.
- [x] Add failing live-order tests for immediate `PartiallyFilled` accounting on both `LEG1` and `LEG2`.
- [x] Update staggered-arb config/defaults so the first 30s are observation-only, `max_initial_sum` can be disabled, `min_entry_sum` is much lower, `max_entry_sigma` no longer clips the intended high-vol regime, and generic/protective close caps can reach `1.20`.
- [x] Implement real-time partial-fill handling so cumulative fills update positions immediately and `LEG1` accepts partials as the actual position size instead of chasing the remainder.
- [x] Re-run targeted live/backtest tests plus isolated host replay comparisons.

## Review

- [x] Confirmed `LEG1` no longer hard-rejects premium sums solely because `UP+DOWN` exceeds the old cap; `max_initial_sum = 0.0` now disables the hard gate in both live and replay, while premium-sum strength gates remain as soft quality filters.
- [x] Confirmed `PartiallyFilled` updates mutate exposure immediately without double-counting on later terminal callbacks; live tests now cover both `LEG1` and `LEG2` cumulative-fill accounting.
- [x] Confirmed host replay stays operational after widening close caps and removing the hard entry-sum gate, but the new profile materially increases trade count and is only flat on the March 5-6 six-hour window.

# Staggered Arb Settlement And Replay-Parity Fixes (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Fix the remaining correctness issues in `staggered_arb` before treating replay as live evidence: expiry settlement must respect partial `LEG2` progress, stale live orders must remain reconcilable, backtest clocks must use simulated fill times, and CLI replay must load the canonical live template instead of drifting defaults.

## Tasks

- [x] Fix live expiry settlement so partial `LEG2` fills are included in payout/cost accounting and late callbacks cannot double-close the same cycle.
- [x] Archive orphaned live orders for reconciliation instead of clearing same-event locks during hard cleanup.
- [x] Fix backtest `LEG2` accumulation so partial closes keep residual exposure open until it is actually hedged or settled.
- [x] Fix backtest entry timing so `wait_deadline` and recorded `leg1_time` use the modeled fill timestamp, not the earlier signal timestamp.
- [x] Make `strategy backtest staggered-arb` load `config/strategies/staggered_arb.toml` and override only CLI-scoped inputs such as symbols / capital.
- [x] Align replay OBI gating with live behavior by rejecting entries when no fresh Binance L2 OBI is available.
- [x] Re-run targeted live/backtest tests.
- [x] Rebuild a Linux artifact locally, upload it to `tango-1-1` in an isolated backtest path, and re-run the standard replay windows.

## Review

- [x] `cargo test strategy::staggered_arb_backtest::tests -- --nocapture` passed with `14/14`.
- [x] `cargo test strategy::staggered_arb_live::tests -- --nocapture` passed with `31/31`.
- [x] On `tango-1-1`, the parity-corrected March windows (`2026-03-05T20:00:00Z` to `2026-03-06T02:00:00Z` and `2026-03-05T04:00:00Z` to `2026-03-06T05:45:00Z`) now produce `0 trades / 0 PnL` because `binance_lob_ticks` coverage for both windows is `0`, so these windows are not valid live-parity evidence.
- [x] On the overlap window `2026-02-24T00:00:00Z` to `2026-02-24T06:00:00Z`, where `binance_lob_ticks` has `38,862` rows, the parity-corrected replay remains healthy: `217 trades`, `91.24%` win rate, `+491.75` PnL, `139.55` profit factor.

## Progress notes

- 2026-03-06: Fixed live expiry settlement so partially-hedged positions settle against actual `LEG2` progress, clear pending hedge markers, and ignore late terminal callbacks after settlement.
- 2026-03-06: Changed orphan hard-cleanup to archive stale live orders instead of dropping event/position locks; late fills can now reconcile safely.
- 2026-03-06: Fixed backtest `fill_leg2` to accumulate partial hedge fills, settle residual exposure at event outcome, and base `wait_deadline` on modeled `LEG1` fill time.
- 2026-03-06: Made CLI staggered-arb replay load the checked-in canonical TOML so shares, thresholds, and timing come from the same source as live config.
- 2026-03-06: Removed replay-only OBI fallback. Missing fresh Binance L2 OBI now blocks entry in replay the same way it does in live.
- 2026-03-06: Rebuilt Linux artifact `ploy-stag-20260306-config-parity`, uploaded it to `/root/ploy/bin/backtests/`, and re-ran host backtests without touching the live service binary.
- 2026-03-06: First production release attempt (`22771138938`) failed in CI because the staggered-arb replay changes depended on the uncommitted `UpdateType::BinanceL2` feed variant in `backtest_feed.rs`; release was halted before deploy and `ploy-platform.service` remained stopped on `tango-1-1`.

## Progress notes

- 2026-03-06: Added `entry_after_start_min_secs = 30`, disabled the hard `max_initial_sum` cap with `0.0`, widened generic/protective close caps to `1.20`, and removed concurrency / per-event trade caps by treating `0` as "disabled" in both live and replay.
- 2026-03-06: Live order tracking now treats `OrderStatus::PartiallyFilled` as an immediate state transition: cumulative filled shares, weighted average price, fees, and remaining exposure are updated before terminal callbacks arrive; `LEG1` partials are accepted as the actual position size and the residual is cancelled.
- 2026-03-06: Added parser/default regression coverage so missing TOML fields no longer silently fall back to the old opening-window profile.
- 2026-03-06: Targeted test suites passed: `strategy::staggered_arb_live::tests` 29/29 and `strategy::staggered_arb_backtest::tests` 10/10.
- 2026-03-06: Isolated replay on `tango-1-1` with `/root/ploy/bin/backtests/ploy-7f22b7f-delayed-obi-realtime-partials` produced mixed regime results:
  - `2026-03-05T20:00:00Z` to `2026-03-06T02:00:00Z`: 202 trades, 97 wins / 105 losses, `+0.71` PnL, profit factor `1.00`.
  - `2026-03-05T04:00:00Z` to `2026-03-06T05:45:00Z`: 648 trades, 345 wins / 303 losses, `+700.64` PnL, profit factor `1.88`.
  - `2026-02-24T00:00:00Z` to `2026-02-24T06:00:00Z`: 1,570 trades, 1,395 wins / 175 losses, `+14171.88` PnL, profit factor `27.97`.

# OBI Long-Gamma Protective Merge Refactor (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Refactor `staggered_arb` from a loose opening-window directional entry into an explicit "OBI-triggered long gamma + capped-loss LEG2" strategy with volatility regime filters and Greeks-assisted protective closes.

## Tasks

- [x] Add failing tests for capped-loss protective LEG2 closes above `force_complete_threshold` but below a new protective cap.
- [x] Add failing tests for volatility-band entry filtering and Greeks-assisted protective merge behavior.
- [x] Implement shared backtest/live config for volatility-band entry and protective LEG2 cap.
- [x] Align live and backtest LEG2 logic so stop-loss / theta urgency can buy `LEG2` up to the protective cap.
- [x] Run targeted strategy tests.
- [x] Run a full-window `staggered-arb` backtest comparison on a fast host using the updated binary.
- [x] Write the approved design doc under `docs/plans/2026-03-06-layered-live-runtime-design.md`.
- [x] Write the implementation plan under `docs/plans/2026-03-06-layered-live-runtime-implementation-plan.md`.
- [x] Commit the planning docs atomically with explicit paths only.

## Review

- [x] Local `staggered_arb` live/backtest test modules pass with the protective-close and sigma-band changes.
- [x] A wide-entry protective profile (`max_initial_sum=1.10`, `max_leg1_price=0.65`, `max_trades_per_event=3`, `max_fair_value_distance=0.25`) still lost money on `tango-1-1` replay: 86 trades, `-55.17` PnL over `2026-03-05T20:00:00Z` to `2026-03-06T02:00:00Z`.
- [x] Tightening the long-gamma entry band (`max_initial_sum=1.04`, `max_leg1_price=0.58`, `max_trades_per_event=2`, `max_fair_value_distance=0.15`) restored positive replay behavior on `tango-1-1`: 31 trades, `+34.60` PnL on the 6h window and 129 trades, `+196.87` PnL on `2026-03-05T04:00:00Z` to `2026-03-06T05:45:00Z`.
- [x] Adding a premium-entry strength gate (`premium_sum_threshold=1.00`, `premium_sum_direction_slope=1.25`, `premium_sum_obi_slope=0.25`) improved the long-window replay on `tango-1-1` to 115 trades and `+228.94` PnL, with profit factor `6.33`, while keeping the 6h window positive at 30 trades and `+32.86` PnL.
- [x] Added historical Binance L2 / OBI parity support to replay backtests, with an explicit fallback to price/Greeks-only entry when the requested window has no fresh `binance_lob_ticks`. On `tango-1-1`, the March 5-6 windows recovered from the temporary `0 trades` regression back to the premium-entry baseline: 30 trades / `+32.86` over 6h and 115 trades / `+228.94` over the full March window.
- [x] Verified the parity gate is active when L2 history exists. On `2026-02-24T00:00:00Z` to `2026-02-24T06:00:00Z`, where `binance_lob_ticks` has 29,208 rows for BTC/ETH/SOL, the premium-entry baseline produced 136 trades / `+784.80` while the parity+fallback build tightened to 124 trades / `+726.62`.

- [x] Confirmed the primary architectural issue is missing canonical live runtime ownership, not lack of layering intent.
- [x] Confirmed `bootstrap.rs` is currently over-coupled to strategy classification, runtime wiring, and strategy-specific behavior.
- [x] Confirmed the target design keeps strategy decisions in the Strategy Plane and limits agentic behavior to capital governance.
- [x] No runtime code changed in this planning step; only design and implementation planning docs were added.

## Progress notes

- 2026-03-06: Completed repository review across `src/strategy`, `src/agents`, `src/platform`, and `src/coordinator/bootstrap.rs`.
- 2026-03-06: Approved target architecture: strategy-owned decisions, agentic capital governance, coordinator-only execution ingress, control-plane-only deployment/config ownership.
- 2026-03-06: Saved design doc to `docs/plans/2026-03-06-layered-live-runtime-design.md`.
- 2026-03-06: Saved implementation plan to `docs/plans/2026-03-06-layered-live-runtime-implementation-plan.md`.

# Staggered Arb Opening-Window Entry Reset (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Restore `staggered_arb` to the intended live behavior: directional `LEG1` entries should be decided near event open, not blocked by an ultra-tight sum gate that rarely appears in production, while `LEG2` remains an opportunistic close.

## Tasks

- [x] Tighten entry timing back to the opening phase instead of leaving entry open for the full event.
- [x] Relax the initial sum cap so opening `LEG1` can fire on realistic BTC/ETH/SOL crypto windows.
- [x] Align backtest/default config with the checked-in live strategy template.
- [x] Add a regression test covering the opening-window entry behavior.

## Review

- [x] `staggered_arb.toml` now limits fresh `LEG1` entries to the first 30 seconds and raises `max_initial_sum` from `0.92` to `1.10`.
- [x] `StaggeredArbBacktestConfig::default()` now matches the live template for opening-window timing and initial-sum assumptions.
- [x] Added a live-unit test proving entries are allowed inside the opening window and rejected after it expires.

---

# Live Order Reconciliation And Binance L2 Persistence Fix (2026-03-07)

## Goal
Fix the post-deploy live issues where managed `staggered_arb` orders showed wrong immediate fill prices, new orders appeared in `signal_history` but not `orders`, and Binance L2 sockets could stay connected while `binance_lob_ticks` stopped advancing.

## Tasks

- [x] Reconcile terminal submit responses by querying the exchange once before trusting the immediate fill price.
- [x] Wire managed strategy runtime order submissions and poll updates into `orders` persistence using the action `client_order_id`.
- [x] Make zero-row `orders` updates fail loudly instead of succeeding silently.
- [x] Replace the fragile Binance diff-depth collector path with a combined partial-depth snapshot stream and freshness tracking.

## Review

- [x] `OrderExecutor` now re-queries terminal immediate fills that arrive without associated trade details, so live records use the exchange-confirmed fill price instead of the submitted limit price.
- [x] Coordinator-managed `split_arb` / `staggered_arb` orders now insert into `orders` before execution and update status/fills on submit and poll transitions.
- [x] `PostgresStore::update_order_status` and `update_order_fill` now error when no `orders` row matches, which exposes persistence regressions immediately.
- [x] `BinanceDepthStream` now uses the combined `@depth20@100ms` snapshot stream, records `BinanceLob` freshness, and rebuilds each snapshot from the message itself instead of accumulating unsynchronized deltas.

# Staggered Arb Dry-Run Gate Diagnostics (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Use the uploaded Linux binary on `tango-1-1` to observe real-time `LEG1` / `LEG2` gate behavior without deploying, so the live inactivity can be attributed to concrete reject reasons instead of inference.

## Tasks

- [x] Add periodic summary output for top `entry_gates` and `leg2_gates`.
- [x] Make foreground dry-run print summaries even when there are zero closed trades.
- [x] Rebuild the Linux binary locally and upload it to the host in an isolated path.
- [x] Run the uploaded binary against an isolated config on `tango-1-1` and capture the gate counts.
- [x] Fix live entry triggering so opening-window `LEG1` evaluation also runs on tick, not only on quote callbacks.

## Progress notes

- 2026-03-06: Added diagnostic summary fields so dry-run can show why `LEG1` is blocked and whether `LEG2` is waiting on merge price, delay, or force-close guards.
- 2026-03-06: Dry-run on `tango-1-1` with the uploaded Linux binary showed `entry_timing_gates` dominating while `entry_signal_gates` stayed `none`; no `LEG1` / `LEG2` actions fired during the sampled windows.
- 2026-03-06: Root cause was live entry evaluation depending on Polymarket quote callbacks; opening windows without a fresh quote update could miss `LEG1` entirely.
- 2026-03-06: Added tick-driven entry rechecks for symbols with a live opening-window candidate and verified on `tango-1-1` dry-run that `SOLUSDT` entered at `06:55:05Z`, merged at `06:55:12Z`, re-entered, and merged again at `06:55:50Z`.

# Trading Host Claim And Settlement Investigation (2026-03-07)

## Goal
Find the exact `tango-1-1` trading-host service names, log locations, and the repo docs/code paths that explain how Polymarket position claiming or settlement should behave when a bought order seems to disappear without visible settlement.

## Tasks

- [ ] Locate exact `systemd` service names and any host/logging paths referenced for `tango-1-1`.
- [ ] Search docs, tasks, and scripts for Polymarket claim/settlement and host-debug guidance.
- [ ] Search runtime code for claimers, expiry settlement, reconciliation, and order/archive flows relevant to disappearing positions.
- [ ] Summarize concise debug-oriented findings with exact file references.
