# Collector consolidation TODO

## Goal
Reduce duplicated market-data collection paths and converge on canonical raw tables.

## Phase 1 (start now)

- [x] Inventory current collector and persistence paths (tables + writers + overlap)
- [x] Add explicit consolidation plan
- [x] Make `orderbook-history` write canonical `clob_orderbook_snapshots` (while keeping legacy `clob_orderbook_history_ticks` for compatibility)
- [x] Add migration note for consumers currently reading `clob_orderbook_history_ticks`

## Phase 2

- [x] Convert `sync_records` from primary sink to derived layer (view/materialized view over raw tables)
- [x] Remove duplicated schema DDL from runtime/CLI paths and centralize
- [x] Deprecate legacy `ticks` pathway after read-side migration

## Phase 3

- [x] Remove or archive `backtest_collector` CSV-only flow from primary data pipeline
- [ ] Add one unified collector docs page (what to run for live vs backfill vs research)
- [ ] Add lightweight data-quality checks (freshness + dedup ratios)

## Progress notes

- 2026-03-04: Started Phase 1 implementation.
- 2026-03-04: `OrderbookHistoryCollector` now mirrors into canonical `clob_orderbook_snapshots` with dedup-by-key (`token_id`, `book_timestamp`, `hash`, `source`) checks.
- 2026-03-04: Added migration note at `tasks/collector_migration_note.md`.
- 2026-03-04: Added `platform::persistence_schema` and switched bootstrap + CLI replay backfill table ensures to shared helpers.
- 2026-03-04: `SyncCollector` now persists canonical raw tables (`binance_lob_ticks`, `clob_quote_ticks`) and creates `sync_records_derived` view; legacy `sync_records` writes are compatibility-only behind `PLOY_COLLECTOR_PERSIST_SYNC_RECORDS`.
- 2026-03-04: Legacy `services/data_collector` now defaults to canonical `clob_quote_ticks`; legacy `ticks` writes require `PLOY_LEGACY_TICKS_ENABLED=true`.
- 2026-03-04: `backtest_collector` CSV sink is now compatibility-only (`persist_csv=false` by default), so primary collector pipeline is DB-first.

# Strategy Deployment Control Plane Stabilization TODO (2026-03-05)

## Goal
Reduce strategy "listing/deployment" chaos by enforcing one control semantics across API surfaces and removing unsafe strategy fallback behavior in platform bootstrap.

## Tasks

- [x] Create implementation plan doc under `docs/plans/` for this stabilization work.
- [x] Align enable/disable governance between `/api/deployments` and `/api/strategies/control/:id`.
- [x] Ensure enabling via `/api/strategies/control/:id` enforces the same evidence gate rules as `/api/deployments`.
- [x] Remove implicit unknown-strategy -> momentum fallback in deployment matrix application.
- [x] Add/adjust tests for deployment strategy mapping and API enable gate behavior.
- [x] Reconcile direct-live gate tests with current documented behavior (blocked by default, env override explicit).
- [x] Run targeted tests and capture results.
- [x] Commit atomic changes with clear scope messages.

## Review

- [x] Verified no unrelated dirty changes were reverted.
- [x] Verified control plane behavior is consistent across endpoints.
- [x] Verified strategy mapping no longer silently routes unknown strategy keys to momentum.

# Trading Host OOM Hardening TODO (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Prevent trading host OOM/timeout caused by on-host Rust builds and missing service memory guards.

## Tasks

- [x] Verify `tango-1-1` runtime state (`rustc/cargo`, `systemd` restart/memory policy, active build processes).
- [x] Pin host default Rust commands to rustup stable (`rustc/cargo` -> latest stable).
- [x] Enforce/automate `systemd` guardrails (`Restart`, `MemoryHigh`, `MemoryMax`, `OOMPolicy`) in GitHub Actions deploy flow.
- [x] Disable legacy remote source-build deploy path by default (`scripts/aws_ec2_deploy.sh` requires explicit override).
- [x] Add trading-host deployment policy to `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

## Review

- [x] Confirmed host now reports `rustc 1.94.0` and `cargo 1.94.0`.
- [x] Confirmed `ploy-platform.service` shows `Restart=always`, `MemoryHigh=1280M`, `MemoryMax=1536M`, `OOMPolicy=kill`.
- [x] Confirmed no active `cargo`/`rustc` compile processes remain on host.

# LEG2 Hotfix Rollout And Acceptance (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Deploy the staggered-arb LEG2 partial-fill hotfix, restart the live platform, and verify online that retries only submit remaining shares while auto-claimer remains active.

## Tasks

- [x] Reproduce the LEG2 retry issue from live fills/logs and identify root cause.
- [x] Implement cumulative LEG2 fill tracking with remaining-shares resubmission.
- [x] Add targeted tests for partial-cancel and cumulative-fill closeout behavior.
- [x] Deploy the hotfix binary to the live host and restart `ploy-platform`.
- [x] Confirm post-restart strategy runtime and auto-claimer startup logs.
- [ ] Confirm a fresh post-restart `STAG-ARB` trade path no longer re-submits full LEG2 size after a partial/failed attempt.
- [x] Review BTC live activity and document why BTC did or did not trade.

## Review

- [x] Local targeted tests and `cargo check` passed before deployment.
- [x] Live host restarted onto the new binary with `--features claimer`.
- [x] Post-restart runtime confirmed active for `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`, `SOLUSDT`; auto-claimer startup confirmed in live logs.
- [x] BTC feed/runtime coverage confirmed after restart; absence of BTC trades so far is lack of qualifying fills/signals in the observed window, not missing subscription.
- [x] No post-restart `orderbook ... does not exist` execution errors were observed in the acceptance window.
- [ ] Fresh post-restart order-path acceptance still pending a real `LEG1` fill that advances into `LEG2`.

# STAG-ARB Live Quote Scoping And Forced-Close Hardening (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Stop live staggered-arb from mixing quotes across event windows, make forced-close price guards real, and ensure runtime config injection does not silently drop BTC.

## Tasks

- [x] Stop live `ploy-platform.service` on `tango-1-1` before local strategy changes.
- [x] Add targeted tests that prove live quotes must be scoped by `event_id`, not only symbol.
- [x] Add targeted tests for `force_complete_threshold` guarding forced Leg2 closes above threshold.
- [x] Change `staggered_arb_live` quote routing/storage from symbol-scoped to event-scoped.
- [x] Wire `force_complete_threshold` into live forced-close paths only.
- [x] Align backtest forced-close threshold semantics with live behavior.
- [x] Fix bootstrap staggered-arb runtime rendering so deployment-scoped `symbols` and `series_ids` override the canonical template without silently dropping BTC.
- [x] Run targeted strategy/bootstrap tests and capture results.

## Review

- [x] Confirmed `ploy-platform.service` on `tango-1-1` is stopped before implementation.
- [x] Verified live staggered-arb no longer reuses quotes across different windows for the same symbol.
- [x] Verified forced close does not buy Leg2 above configured threshold.
- [x] Verified runtime-rendered staggered-arb config injects both symbols and series IDs.

## Progress notes

- 2026-03-06: `tango-1-1` `ploy-platform.service` stopped successfully; host reported `inactive (dead)` immediately after manual stop.
- 2026-03-06: Added live regression test `test_try_entry_uses_event_scoped_quotes` and switched live PM quote storage/routing to `event_id` scope.
- 2026-03-06: Added live/backtest threshold tests so forced timeout paths are blocked when `force_complete_threshold=1.00` and combined sum exceeds $1.
- 2026-03-06: Added live event-expiry settlement path so single-leg `FINAL WINDOW HOLD` positions and threshold-blocked positions do not remain stuck open forever.
- 2026-03-06: Fixed bootstrap staggered-arb runtime rendering so managed config derives from the canonical template while overriding both deployment-scoped symbols and series IDs.
- 2026-03-06: Verified with targeted tests:
  - `cargo test test_try_entry_uses_event_scoped_quotes -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test test_force_threshold_blocks_forced_timeout_above_cap -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test test_force_complete_threshold_blocks_backtest_timeout_above_cap -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test build_split_arb_runtime_config_overrides_template_symbols_and_series_ids -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test staggered_arb_live::tests -- --nocapture`

# Managed Staggered Arb Runtime And Release Workflow Merge (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Fold the separate hotfix worktree back into this strategy branch without regressing the live quote-scoping fixes: keep share-based managed runtime generation, preserve partial-fill retry behavior, and make the Aliyun release workflow explicitly start inactive ploy services.

## Tasks

- [x] Compare the current worktree against `hotfix/leg2-reconcile-20260306` and identify overlapping files.
- [x] Keep the live `staggered_arb` partial-fill reconciliation logic while verifying it does not conflict with event-scoped quote routing.
- [x] Reconcile managed runtime generation in `bootstrap.rs` so it derives from the canonical `staggered_arb.toml` template instead of hardcoded fallback defaults.
- [x] Bring over the release workflow changes that package/install `staggered_arb.toml` and explicitly `start` or `restart` installed ploy services.
- [x] Merge both sessions' `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md` records instead of dropping one side's incident history.
- [x] Run targeted validation on merged bootstrap/workflow changes and capture the result.

## Review

- [x] Confirmed the only real semantic conflict was managed runtime generation in `bootstrap.rs`; `staggered_arb_live.rs` changes were additive.
- [x] Kept `force_complete_threshold = 1.00` in the checked-in strategy template to preserve the bad-price forced-close guard.
- [x] Preserved the hotfix-side partial-fill retry logic and exchange-order reconciliation already present in the current worktree.

## Progress notes

- 2026-03-06: Compared this worktree with `hotfix/leg2-reconcile-20260306` and found overlap in `bootstrap.rs`, `staggered_arb.toml`, `staggered_arb_live.rs`, `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/lessons.md`, plus the uncommitted `release-aliyun.yml` follow-up.
- 2026-03-06: Resolved bootstrap by keeping template-derived managed runtime rendering and deployment-scoped overrides for `symbols` and `series_ids`.
- 2026-03-06: Resolved workflow merge by keeping packaged `staggered_arb.toml`, explicit ploy unit handling, and `wait_for_unit_active` for both `start` and `restart` paths.
- 2026-03-06: Revalidated merged state with `cargo test bootstrap -- --nocapture`, `cargo test build_split_arb_runtime_config_ -- --nocapture`, `cargo test staggered_arb_live::tests -- --nocapture`, and a YAML parse check for `.github/workflows/release-aliyun.yml`.

# Managed Staggered Arb Runtime And Release Workflow Closure (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Keep managed `staggered_arb` on share-based sizing, ship the canonical strategy template in release bundles, and make the Aliyun rollout path recover installed inactive services automatically.

## Tasks

- [x] Confirm managed runtime sizing drift came from bootstrap rendering, not host config drift.
- [x] Render managed split-arb runtime from the canonical `staggered_arb.toml` template while keeping runtime symbol/series overrides.
- [x] Include `staggered_arb.toml` in the release bundle and install it on the host during rollout.
- [x] Update the release restart step so installed inactive `ploy` services are started and waited to `active`.
- [x] Extend the release restart step to include installed `ploy-deribit-*` collectors.

## Review

- [x] Managed runtime rendering now preserves `shares_per_trade = 20` and does not inject `fixed_amount_usd`.
- [x] Release workflow now deploys `staggered_arb.toml` alongside `momentum.toml`.
- [x] Release workflow restart logic now handles both `restart` and `start`, with an explicit `active` wait loop.
- [x] Release workflow now discovers and restarts installed `ploy-deribit-*` collector units on the trading host.

# Layered Live Runtime Refactor Design And Planning (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Define the target four-layer live trading architecture and write a concrete implementation plan to converge the repo onto one canonical strategy runtime.

## Tasks

- [x] Review the current architecture against the target four-layer model.
- [x] Validate target boundaries for Strategy, Capital Governance, Execution, and Control planes.
- [x] Write the approved design doc under `docs/plans/2026-03-06-layered-live-runtime-design.md`.
- [x] Write the implementation plan under `docs/plans/2026-03-06-layered-live-runtime-implementation-plan.md`.
- [x] Commit the planning docs atomically with explicit paths only.

## Review

- [x] Confirmed the primary architectural issue is missing canonical live runtime ownership, not lack of layering intent.
- [x] Confirmed `bootstrap.rs` is currently over-coupled to strategy classification, runtime wiring, and strategy-specific behavior.
- [x] Confirmed the target design keeps strategy decisions in the Strategy Plane and limits agentic behavior to capital governance.
- [x] No runtime code changed in this planning step; only design and implementation planning docs were added.

## Progress notes

- 2026-03-06: Completed repository review across `src/strategy`, `src/agents`, `src/platform`, and `src/coordinator/bootstrap.rs`.
- 2026-03-06: Approved target architecture: strategy-owned decisions, agentic capital governance, coordinator-only execution ingress, control-plane-only deployment/config ownership.
- 2026-03-06: Saved design doc to `docs/plans/2026-03-06-layered-live-runtime-design.md`.
- 2026-03-06: Saved implementation plan to `docs/plans/2026-03-06-layered-live-runtime-implementation-plan.md`.

# Layered Live Runtime Task 1: Canonical Ownership Freeze (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Make the canonical live runtime ownership explicit in source comments before any behavioral migration work starts.

## Tasks

- [x] Mark `src/strategy/traits.rs` as the only canonical live strategy contract.
- [x] Mark `src/agents/traits.rs` as a transitional compatibility surface.
- [x] Mark `src/platform/traits.rs` / `DomainAgent` as transitional compatibility only.
- [x] Add a short architecture note to `src/strategy/mod.rs` directing new live strategy work to the canonical path.
- [x] Record the immediate freeze rule in `docs/plans/2026-03-06-layered-live-runtime-design.md`.
- [x] Validate with `cargo check --lib`.
- [x] Commit the Task 1 boundary freeze atomically.

## Review

- [x] No runtime logic changed in this step.
- [x] The change is limited to ownership comments and migration guidance.
- [x] `cargo check --lib` passed; only pre-existing warnings remained in unrelated backtest files.

---

# Layered Live Runtime Task 2: Shrink Strategy Contract (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Remove governance/feed-lifecycle mutations from the canonical `StrategyAction` contract and keep live strategy outputs decision-only.

## Tasks

- [x] Remove `UpdateRisk`, `SubscribeFeed`, and `UnsubscribeFeed` from `src/strategy/traits.rs`.
- [x] Delete obsolete consumer branches in `src/strategy/orchestrator.rs`, `src/coordinator/bootstrap.rs`, and `src/cli/strategy.rs`.
- [x] Convert compiled strategy/runtime code to static feed ownership, including `src/strategy/gamma_scalping/strategy.rs`.
- [x] Synchronize legacy `src/strategy/strategies/*` implementations with the new contract so they no longer rely on runtime-owned actions.
- [x] Add focused regression tests for static feed declarations and event-handling behavior where compiled coverage exists.
- [x] Run focused validation and capture the results.
- [x] Commit the Task 2 contract shrink atomically.

## Review

- [x] Confirmed `DataFeedManager::start_for_feeds()` already owns Polymarket series discovery and token-quote subscription for the compiled runtime path.
- [x] Confirmed `gamma_scalping` now keeps `required_feeds()` static and no longer requests dynamic quote subscriptions on event discovery.
- [x] Confirmed canonical runtime consumers no longer accept strategy-originated governance mutations or feed rewiring requests.
- [x] Focused validation passed:
  - `cargo test strategy::manager --lib -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test strategy::gamma_scalping::strategy --lib -- --nocapture`
- [x] Validation still shows only the same pre-existing warnings in unrelated backtest files (`liquidity_vacuum_backtest.rs`, `garch_probability_backtest.rs`).
- [x] `src/strategy/strategies/momentum_strat.rs` and `src/strategy/strategies/two_leg.rs` were synchronized to the new contract, but they are not currently reachable from `src/strategy/mod.rs`, so the runtime validation for this task remains centered on the compiled canonical path.

# Staggered Arb Opening-Window Entry Reset (2026-03-06)

## Goal
Restore `staggered_arb` to the intended live behavior: directional `LEG1` entries should be decided near event open, not blocked by an ultra-tight sum gate that rarely appears in production, while `LEG2` remains an opportunistic close.

## Tasks

- [x] Tighten entry timing back to the opening phase instead of leaving entry open for the full event.
- [x] Relax the initial sum cap so opening `LEG1` can fire on realistic BTC/ETH/SOL crypto windows.
- [x] Align backtest/default config with the checked-in live strategy template.
- [x] Add a regression test covering the opening-window entry behavior.

## Review

- [x] `staggered_arb.toml` now limits fresh `LEG1` entries to the first 30 seconds and raises `max_initial_sum` from `0.92` to `1.10`.
- [x] `StaggeredArbBacktestConfig::default()` now matches the live template for opening-window timing and initial-sum assumptions.
- [x] Added a live-unit test proving entries are allowed inside the opening window and rejected after it expires.
