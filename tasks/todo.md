# Collector consolidation TODO

## Goal
Reduce duplicated market-data collection paths and converge on canonical raw tables.

## Phase 1 (start now)

- [x] Inventory current collector and persistence paths (tables + writers + overlap)
- [x] Add explicit consolidation plan
- [x] Make `orderbook-history` write canonical `clob_orderbook_snapshots` (while keeping legacy `clob_orderbook_history_ticks` for compatibility)
- [x] Add migration note for consumers currently reading `clob_orderbook_history_ticks`

## Phase 2

- [x] Convert `sync_records` from primary sink to derived layer (view/materialized view over raw tables)
- [x] Remove duplicated schema DDL from runtime/CLI paths and centralize
- [x] Deprecate legacy `ticks` pathway after read-side migration

## Phase 3

- [x] Remove or archive `backtest_collector` CSV-only flow from primary data pipeline
- [ ] Add one unified collector docs page (what to run for live vs backfill vs research)
- [ ] Add lightweight data-quality checks (freshness + dedup ratios)

## Progress notes

- 2026-03-04: Started Phase 1 implementation.
- 2026-03-04: `OrderbookHistoryCollector` now mirrors into canonical `clob_orderbook_snapshots` with dedup-by-key (`token_id`, `book_timestamp`, `hash`, `source`) checks.
- 2026-03-04: Added migration note at `tasks/collector_migration_note.md`.
- 2026-03-04: Added `platform::persistence_schema` and switched bootstrap + CLI replay backfill table ensures to shared helpers.
- 2026-03-04: `SyncCollector` now persists canonical raw tables (`binance_lob_ticks`, `clob_quote_ticks`) and creates `sync_records_derived` view; legacy `sync_records` writes are compatibility-only behind `PLOY_COLLECTOR_PERSIST_SYNC_RECORDS`.
- 2026-03-04: Legacy `services/data_collector` now defaults to canonical `clob_quote_ticks`; legacy `ticks` writes require `PLOY_LEGACY_TICKS_ENABLED=true`.
- 2026-03-04: `backtest_collector` CSV sink is now compatibility-only (`persist_csv=false` by default), so primary collector pipeline is DB-first.
